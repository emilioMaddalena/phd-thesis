\chapter{Safely learning with kernels}
\markboth{Learning with kernels}{Learning with kernels}

At its core, learning refers to the process of \textit{gathering information} and using it to \textit{improve one's knowledge} about the subject or phenomenon under study. The standing assumption here is then clearly that a link is in place, tying information and phenomenon together even if such link is partially corrupted. Information typically comes in the form of data, samples, sometimes referred to as examples, and
%In modern machine learning, people study a number of rather abstract subjects ranging from the traits that distinguish images of muffins and chihuahuas, to the link between passengers' features and their survival likelihood in case of a ship sinking event.  
the mathematical formalism often used in modern machine learning to study the link between examples and the underlying phenomena is statistics. This choice is convenient because it can describe the possible non-determinism of outcomes through the concepts of distributions and samples; and because it provides us with plenty of tools to carry out learning, i.e., improve our knowledge about the phenomenon through the samples at hand. In this chapter, we will however adopt a different standpoint to study and tackle the problem of learning, which is, as we will later argue, more aligned with the ways control engineers are taught to see physical systems. This standpoint is the one offered by approximation theory.

In this chapter, we will introduce the problem of learning from data and elucidate what approach will be taken to tackle it. Next, novel uncertainty quantification results will be presented concerning the point-evaluations of an  unknown ground-truth. Finally, some examples are given to illustrate the general use of the theory.

\mycomment{Statistical learning and approximation theory are not in opposition. Indeed, we can define the function of interest as the conditional \cite{temlyakov2008approximation}, perhaps talk about Belkin's work linking the two and advocating for using the approximation lenses.}

\section{The formalism of kernels}
\label{sec.formalism_of_kernels}

Our goal in to learn maps of the form $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and, to achieve that end, we will make extensive use of auxiliary functions called kernels.

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{(Kernel)} Given an arbitrary non-empty set $\mathcal{X}$, a kernel $k$ is any symmetric function of the form
	\begin{equation}
		k: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{(Kernel matrix)} Let $X = \{x_1,\dots,x_n\} \subset \mathcal{X}$ be a finite set of points. The $n \times n$ matrix $K_{XX}$ with entries $[K_{XX}]_{ij} = k(x_i,x_j)$ is called the kernel matrix of $k$ associated with $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	\label{def.pd_kernel}
	\textbf{(Positive-definite kernel)} A kernel function $k$ is said to be positive-definite if for any finite subset of points $X \subset \mathcal{X}$, the kernel matrix satisfies $K_{XX} \succeq 0$. If, in particular, $K_{XX} \succ 0$, then the kernel is strictly positive-definite.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	Aside from the last definition, we underline that there exist broader classes of kernel functions such as the \textit{conditionally positive-definite} one \cite[ยง2.4]{scholkopf2002learning}\cite[ยง8]{wendland2004scattered}. In this chapter however, our attention will be focused on the positive-definite (PD) set, from which some examples are shown in Figure~\ref{fig.pd_kernels}. A more complete list of PD kernels and their mathematical properties can be found in Appendix~A.
\end{remark}

In order to construct surrogate models for the unknown $f$ one could partially evaluate a given $k$ to match their domains and co-domains, in other words, fix one of its arguments so that $k(z,\cdot): \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, x \mapsto k(z,x)$ for some $z \in \mathcal{X}$. Indeed, this was the approach taken to draw the plots in Figure~\ref{fig.pd_kernels}. Approximating the unknown $f$ with a single partially evaluated kernel however appears to be overly restrictive. A sensible next step would be to consider linear combinations of such kernel functions. It turns out that every PD kernel has a function space associated with it that contains these linear combinations and is endowed with plenty of useful geometric structure. The following concepts are presented next to set up the stage for defining this special hypothesis space, the \textit{reproducing kernel Hilbert space}.

\end{figure}

\begin{proposition}
	\label{thm.pd_kernels_feature_maps}
	\textbf{(PD kernels have feature maps)} 
	Let $k:\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ be a positive-definite kernel. Then there exists a Hilbert space $\mathbb{H}$ endowed with an inner product $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle_\mathbb{H}$ and a mapping $\Phi :  \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$ such that 
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq.kernels_feat_maps}
		k(x,x') = \langle \Phi(x),\Phi(x') \rangle_\mathbb{H}
	\end{equation}
	holds for any $x,x' \in \mathcal{X}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{my_proof}
	\cite[Theorem~4.16]{steinwart2008svm_book}, modulo the nomenclature difference.
\end{my_proof}

Feature maps $\Phi$ are central in machine learning, allowing one to represent the data $x$ he has in a more suitable format. At the same time, \eqref{eq.kernels_feat_maps} unveils another aspect of a kernel evaluation $k(x,x')$: it returns the inner-product value of the transformed inputs $\Phi(x)$, $\Phi(x')$. Educational textbooks often interpret these inner-products as a similarity measure between $x$ and $x'$ \citep{scholkopf2002learning}.

The mappings $\Phi$ above as well as the $\mathbb{H}$ spaces are in general not unique \citep[ยง4]{steinwart2008svm_book}, but there is one such space that enjoys an extra property that rules out some unexpected behavior from its members. This particular $\mathbb{H}$ is moreover not an arbitrary Hilbert space, but a Hilbert space of functions.

\begin{definition}
	\label{def.rkhs}
	\textbf{(Reproducing kernel Hilbert space)} 
	Let $\mathcal{X} \neq \emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}^\mathcal{X}$ the set of functions mapping $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathbb{R}$. The subset $\mathcal{H} \subset \mathbb{R}^\mathcal{X}$ is called a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) if it is a Hilbert space and if $\forall x \in \mathcal{X}$ the evaluation functionals
	\begin{equation}
		L_x: \mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \; L_x(f) \mapsto f(x), \ \forall f\in \mathcal{H}
	\end{equation}
	are bounded.
\end{definition}

In order to see how useful such a property is, consider a sequence $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ within a certain Hilbert function space $\mathbb{H} \subset \mathbb{R}^\mathcal{X}$. Intuitively, one would expect that if $f_n \rightarrow f^\star$ in $\mathbb{H}$, then the values $f_n(x)$ attained by the sequence would converge to the values $f^\star(x)$. Yet, this is not always the case (see Example~\ref{ex.appendix_convergence} in Appendix~\ref{app.elements_analysis_algebra}). If, on the other hand, the evaluation functionals are bounded as in Definition~\ref{def.rkhs}, then the connection between convergence in the function space and the pointwise convergence of functions is guaranteed. Indeed, if $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ and $f^\star$ are members of an RKHS $\mathcal{H}$, then $|f_n(x)-f^\star(x)| = | L_x(f_n) - L_x(f^\star)|  \leq \Vert L_x \Vert \rknorm{f_n - f^\star}$, where $\Vert L_x \Vert $ is the operator norm of $L_x$ that is guaranteed by Definiton~\ref{def.rkhs} to be a finite number. As a result, if $\rknorm{f_n - f^\star} \rightarrow 0$, the right-hand side of the inequality goes to zero, and so does the pointwise difference $|f_n(x)-f^\star(x)|$. Therefore, function convergence in an RKHS implies pointwise convergence, matching our intuition.

\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop.unique_reprod_kernel}
	\textbf{(Every RKHS has a unique PD reproducing kernel)} 
	Let $\mathcal{H} \subset \mathbb{R}^\mathcal{X}$ be an RKHS. Then, the map $k: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $k(x,x') := \langle L_x, L_{x'} \rangle_\mathcal{H}$ is a positive-definite kernel. Furthermore, $k$ is the unique map to satisfy the reproducing property, i.e., for any $x \in \mathcal{X}$, $k(x,\cdot) \in \rkhs$ and
	\begin{equation}
		\rkinner{f}{k(x,\cdot)} = L_x(f) = f(x), \ \forall f \in \rkhs
		\label{eq.reproducing_property}
	\end{equation} 
\end{proposition}

\begin{my_proof}
	 \cite[Lemma~2]{berlinet2011reproducing} along with \citep[Theorem~4.20]{steinwart2008svm_book}.
\end{my_proof}

\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop.unique_rkhs}
	\textbf{(Every PD kernel has a unique RKHS)} 
	Let $k: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a PD kernel. If $k$ is the reproducing kernel of an RKHS $\rkhs_A$ and of another RKHS $\rkhs_B$, then $\rkhs_A = \rkhs_B$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{my_proof}
	\citep[Theorem~4.21]{steinwart2008svm_book}.
\end{my_proof}

Despite being part of their name, it is not clear from the definition above what the relationship between RKHSs and kernels is. To shed light on the matter, it helps to explicitly construct $\rkhs$ starting from a given $k$. Consider the so-called \textit{pre-Hilbert space}
\begin{empheq}[box={\mymathbox[colback=black!2,drop small lifted shadow, sharp corners]}]{align}
	\rkhs_0 :=& \; \text{span} \, \{ k(x,\cdot) \, | \, x \in \mathcal{X} \} \\
 	=&  \; \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \, k(x_i,\cdot) \, | \, n \in \mathbb{N}, c_i \in \mathbb{R}, x_i \in \mathcal{X} \right\} \label{eq.pre_rkhs}
\end{empheq}
equipped with the real-valued map $\langle f,g\rangle_{\mathcal{H}_0} := \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m a_i b_i k(x_i,x_j)$ for members $f,g \in \mathcal{H}_0, f=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \, k(x_i,\cdot), g=\sum_{j=1}^m b_j \, k(x_j,\cdot) $, which can be shown to be a valid inner-product. This family $\mathcal{H}_0$ of functions is however not guaranteed to be complete, i.e., sequences $\{f_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ of members might converge to functions outside $\mathcal{H}_0$. To transform it into a proper Hilbert space, one closes the space 
\begin{empheq}[box={\mymathbox[colback=black!2,drop small lifted shadow, sharp corners]}]{equation}
	\label{eq.rkhs_closure}
	\mathcal{H} := \text{clos} \, \mathcal{H}_0
\end{empheq}
%\begin{equation}
%	\mathcal{H} := \text{clos} \, \mathcal{H}_0
%\end{equation}
thus encompassing all limit points\footnote{
%
Closing $\mathcal{H}_0$ requires defining an inner-product on the superset $\rkhs$ that is consistent with the one present in the subset $\mathcal{H}_0$. Also, the closure of a set is always closed, which guarantees that sequences within $\mathcal{H}$ cannot converge to functions outside of it.
%
}. Finally, the function space $\mathcal{H}$ defined in \eqref{eq.rkhs_closure} can then be shown to be a valid RKHS\footnote{
%
For a proof of this statement, the reader is referred to \cite[ยง3]{berlinet2011reproducing} or to \cite[ยง4]{sejdinovic2012rkhs} for a more step-by-step pedagogical exposition.
%
} according to Definition~\ref{def.rkhs}. In fact, it is the \textit{only} one associated with $k$. We therefore understand that the members of $\rkhs$ are weighted sums of partially evaluated kernels as per \eqref{eq.pre_rkhs} along with their limit points. 
%and requires showing that the elements included through the closure are indeed functions with well-defined point evaluations \cite[ยง4]{aronszajn1950theory}\cite[ยง10.2]{wendland2004scattered}, a step that is overlooked in simplified presentations.

The questions of how expressive RKHSs can be still lingers on. To better examine the matter, consider the following measure of expressiveness.

\begin{definition}
	\textbf{(Universal kernel)}
	\label{def.universal_kernel}
	Let $k$ be a continuous PD kernel and the set $\mathcal{X}$ be a compact metric space. Then $k$ is called universal if its RKHS $\rkhs \subset \mathbb{R}^\mathcal{X}$ is dense in the space of real-valued continuous functions $C(\mathcal{X}) \subset \mathbb{R}^\mathcal{X}$ with respect to the maximum norm $\Vert \cdot \Vert_\infty$.
\end{definition}

The above definition guarantees that for any target function $g \in C(\mathcal{X})$ and any tolerable error $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $f$ in the RKHS of a universal kernel such that their mismatch is bounded $| f(x) - g(x) | \leq \epsilon, \forall x \in \mathcal{X}$.
% REFINE
All in all, the universality property is an indication of how rich a hypothesis space is, thus reassuring the user that little bias error will be introduced by his choice of model class.

\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop.univ_kernels}
	Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. The following are universal kernels
	\begin{align}
		&k(x,x') := \exp( \langle x, x' \rangle) \\
		&k(x,x') := \exp\left( - \frac{\Vert x - x' \Vert^2_2}{2 \gamma^2} \right) \label{eq.squared_exponential}
	\end{align}
	where $\gamma >0$ and $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ is the usual inner-product on $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{my_proof}
	\cite[Corollary~4.58]{steinwart2008svm_book}.
\end{my_proof}

In contrast with Proposition~\ref{prop.univ_kernels}, some results on the restrictiveness of RKHSs can also be found in the literature. In \cite{steinwart2020_no_rkhs_cont_func} for example, the author shows that no RKHS can contain $C(X)$. On a looser note, some authors argue that members of the squared-exponential kernel \eqref{eq.squared_exponential} has an $\rkhs$ that is too smooth when compared to alternative hypothesis spaces that are also associated with the same kernel (see the discussion in \cite[ยง4]{kanagawa2018gaussian}). For a thorough exposition of universal kernels, the reader is referred to \cite{micchelli2006universal}. Lastly, we underline that other model classes in machine learning also enjoy the same universality properties that kernels do, notable certain architectures of deep neural networks \citep{kidger2020universal}.

\section{Crafting models}
\label{sec.crafting_models}

Suppose a dataset of the form $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ is given. The $x_i \in \mathcal{X}, \forall i$ elements are referred to as \textit{inputs} and the $y_i \in \mathbb{R}, \forall i$ as \textit{outputs}. In this section, we will discuss exclusively the case where $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is a compact set, and the outputs are real-valued. The values $y_i$ are assumed to deliver information about the underlying ground-truth function $f^\star$ through the measurement model
\begin{equation}
	y_i = f^\star(x_i) + \epsilon_i, \quad i=1,\dots,n
\end{equation}

%For convenience, $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^n$ will represent the vector of stacked real values $\alpha_i, i=1,\dots,n$. Similarly, $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the vector form of the individual outputs $y_i,i=1,\dots,n$. Let $k_{Xx} : \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ be the vector-valued function $x \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} k(x_1,x) & \dots & k(x_n,x)\end{bmatrix}$.

As detailed in Section~\ref{sec.formalism_of_kernels}, weighted sums of partially evaluated kernel functions arise naturally in the context of kernel learning. In this section we shall see that, when given $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$, maps of the form
\begin{equation}
	f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i k(x_i,x)
\end{equation}
partially evaluated at the inputs $x_i$ are good candidates for acting as surrogate functions for the ground-truth $f^\star$. Indeed, they are known to solve a number of optimal fitting problems given appropriate weights $\alpha$ as we explain next.

In the absence of measurement noise, i.e., when $\epsilon_i = 0$, the outputs $y_i$ perfectly represent $f^\star$. Consequently, data interpolation can be a sensible task to carry out, which could be carried out over $f \in \rkhs$ while minimizing the resulting model norm.
%\begin{align}
%		\bar{f} = \arginf_{f \in \mathcal{H}} & \quad \rknorm{f}^2 \\
%		\text{subj. to} & \quad f(x_i) = y_i, \, i = 1,\dots,n 
%\end{align}
\begin{proposition}
	\textbf{(Minimum-norm interpolation (MNI))}
	Let $\{x_i,y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a collection of points such that $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $k$ be a PD kernel and $\rkhs \subset \mathbb{R}^\mathcal{X}$ its RKHS. Then, the variational problem
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq.min_norm_interp}
			\bar{f} \in \arginf_{f \in \mathcal{H}} \left\{ \rknorm{f}^2 : f(x_i) = y_i, \, i = 1,\dots,n \right\}
	\end{equation}
	admits the unique solution $\bar f \in \rkhs$, $\bar f(x) =  \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i k(x_i,x)$, $\alpha = y^\top K_{XX}^{-1}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{my_proof}
	\cite[Theorem~3.5]{kanagawa2018gaussian}.
\end{my_proof}

Some might think that models of the form \eqref{eq.min_norm_interp} would perform poorly in real-world scenarios as overfitting goes against established machine learning guidelines. Yet, some authors have recently advocated for such models, and interpolants in general, stating that they possess strong generalization capabilities (see e.g. \cite{belkin2018understand,belkin2019reconciling,beaglehole2022kernel}).

To tackle the approximation problem in the presence of measurement noise, a compromise between fitting the data and rejecting uninformative fluctuations is sometimes desirable. One of the most standard tools used to achieve this balance is kernel ridge regression (KRR), in which the unconstrained problem

\begin{proposition}
	\textbf{(Kernel ridge regression (KRR))}
	Let $\{x_i,y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a collection of points such that $x_i \in \mathcal{X}$ for a compact $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ and $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $k$ be a SPD kernel and $\rkhs \subset \mathbb{R}^\mathcal{X}$ its RKHS. Then, the variational problem
	\begin{equation}
		\inf_{f\in \rkhs} \; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i))^2 + \lambda \Vert f \Vert_\rkhs^2
	\end{equation}
	with $\lambda > 0$ admits a single minimizer, the function $f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i x_i$ with $\alpha = (K_{XX} + n \lambda I)^{-1} y$. 
\end{proposition}


Original representer theorem \cite{kimeldorf1971some}.

\begin{theorem}
	\textbf{(The representer theorem)}
	Let $\{x_i,y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a collection of points such that $x_i \in \mathcal{X}$ for an arbitrary $\mathcal{X}$ and $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $k$ be a PD kernel and $\rkhs \subset \mathbb{R}^\mathcal{X}$ its RKHS. Consider an arbitrary function $c : (\mathcal{X} \times R^2)^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \cup \{\infty\}$ and a strictly monotonic increasing function $\Omega: [0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Then, if $f \in \rkhs$ is a minimizer of the variational problem
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq.representer_theorem_general_loss}
		\inf_{f\in \rkhs} c((x_1,y_1,f(x_1)),\dots,(x_n,y_n,f(x_n))) + \Omega(\Vert f \Vert_\rkhs)
	\end{equation}
	admits a representation of the form $f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i x_i$, with $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{R}$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{my_proof}
	The proof is given in \cite{scholkopf2001generalized}.
\end{my_proof}

Specializing \eqref{eq.representer_theorem_general_loss} to a more usual loss function, we arrive at the well-known kernel ridge regression (KRR) problem, which admits a unique, closed-form solution.


\section{Quantifying uncertainty}

Besides being able to craft surrogate functions for our unknown ground-truth, it is also a common desideratum to understand how far away our predictions can be from the real phenomenon. We will start this section by formalizing the problem of bounding the ground-truth values that can be attained even at unseen locations given the information at hand. It is important to highlight that this process will not require a model. Next, alternative bounds are developed, this time around nominal models such as the ones presented in Section~\ref{sec.crafting_models}. Rather than limiting ourselves to the theoretical sphere, the discussion will also touch on the computational aspects involved in evaluating the derived expressions.

\subsection{The setting and problem definition}

The theory developed in this section will revolve around a specific class of kernels and input spaces as stated next.

\begin{assumption}
	\label{as:kernel_spd_compact_X}
	 $k$ is strictly positive-definite and defined on a compact $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^m$.
\end{assumption}

Regarding the unknown ground-truth function $f^\star$, the following are assumed.

\begin{assumption}
	\label{as:rkhs_contains_gt}
	$f^\star$ is contained in the RKHS $\rkhs$ associated with $k$.
\end{assumption}

\begin{assumption}
	An estimate $\Gamma \geq \rknorm{f^\star}$ for the ground-truth norm is known.
\end{assumption}


The available data $\{(x_i,\mathsf{y}_i)\}_{i=1}^d$ is such that $x_i \in \mathcal{X}$ and $\mathsf{y}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i}$, where the vector $\mathsf{y}_i = \begin{bmatrix}y_{i,1} & \dots & y_{i,n_i} \end{bmatrix}^\top$ contains $n_i$ scalar samples collected at the same input location $x_i$. The outputs are assumed to carry information about an underlying unknown ground-truth map $f^\star$ according to
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq.observational_model}
	y_{i,j} = f^\star(x_i) + \delta_{i,j}
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{i,j}$ denotes an additive measurement noise. If only a single output is present at each input location, the observational model \eqref{eq.observational_model} simplifies to $y_{i} = f^\star(x_i) + \delta_{i}$.

 that is assumed to be uniformly bounded \textcolor{red}{as stated next.}

\begin{assumption}
	\label{as:noisebound}
	The magnitude of each noise realization $\delta_{i,j}$ is bounded by a known scalar quantity $\bar{\delta}$, i.e. $|\delta_{i,j}| \leq \bar \delta, \forall i,j$.
\end{assumption}

To upper bound the ground-truth values, we consider the following infinite-dimensional variational problem $\mathds{P}0$, with the query point $x \in \Omega$ as a parameter
\begin{empheq}[box={\mymathbox[colback=black!2,drop small lifted shadow, sharp corners]}]{equation}
		\label{eq.infdimprob}
		\text{F}(x) = \sup_{f \, \in \mathcal{H}} \, \{ f(x) : \rknorm{f} \leq \Gamma, \infnorm{f_X - \mathsf{y}} \leq \bar \delta \} 
\end{empheq}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq.infdimprob}
%		\text{F}(x) = \sup_{f \, \in \mathcal{H}} \, \{ f(x) : \rknorm{f} \leq \Gamma, \infnorm{f_X - \mathsf{y}} \leq \bar \delta \} 
%\end{equation}
where $f_X := \Lambda \begin{bmatrix} f(x_1) & \dots & f(x_d) \end{bmatrix}^\top$ is the vector of evaluations at the input locations, which are repeated whenever multiple outputs are available at a given input. This is accomplished through $\Lambda$ as defined in Appendix~\ref{app.thebigmatrix}. We highlight that the supremum is guaranteed to exist thanks to \eqref{eq.uniformBound}. Given a query location $x$, $\mathds{P}0$ yields the tightest
%\footnote{\textcolor{red}{This adjective has to be understood in the sense that for any other possible candidate bound $\epsilon$ such that $\epsilon<F(x)$, there exists an $\tilde{f}$ compatible with our assumptions that violates this bound. This means, $\Vert \tilde{f} \Vert_\mathcal{H} \leq \Gamma$, $\Vert \tilde{f}_X-\mathsf{y} \Vert_\infty\leq \bar{\delta}$, and $\tilde{f}(x)>\epsilon$.}} 
upper bound for $f(x)$ over all members $f \in \mathcal{H}$ of our hypothesis space that are consistent with our dataset, as well as our knowledge on the ground-truth complexity $\rknorm{f} \leq \Gamma$. Note how linking the function evaluations $f_X$ and the outputs $\mathsf{y}$ plays a role analogous to conditioning stochastic processes on past observations in statistical frameworks.

\subsection{The optimal solution}

Consider now the convex parametric quadratically-constrained linear program $\mathds{P}1$ 
\begin{empheq}[box={\mymathbox[colback=black!2,drop small lifted shadow, sharp corners]}]{align}
	\label{eq.P1case1}
	{\normalfont \text{C}(x)} \; = \max_{c \in \mathds{R}^d, c_x \in \mathds{R}}&  \quad c_x  \\

	\end{bmatrix} \leq \Gamma^2  \label{eq.P1constrA} \\
	& \ \; \; \infnorm{\Lambda c - \mathsf{y}} \leq \bar\delta \label{eq.P1constrB}
\end{empheq}
%\begin{subequations}
%	\label{eq.P2case1}
%	\begin{align}
%		{\normalfont \text{C}(x)} \; = \max_{c \in \mathds{R}^d, c_x \in \mathds{R}}&  \quad c_x  \\

%		& \ \; \; \infnorm{\Lambda c - \mathsf{y}} \leq \bar\delta \label{eq.P2constrB}
%	\end{align}

for any $x \in \Omega \backslash \{X\}$, and extend its value function to points $x = x_i \in X$ with the solution of $\mathds{P}1': \, \text{C}(x) \,=\, \max_{c \in \mathbb{R}^d} \{c_i \, | \, c^\top K_{XX}^{-1}c \leq \Gamma^2, \, \infnorm{\Lambda \, c - \mathsf{y}} \leq \bar \delta \}$.
This can be thought of as finding a map that interpolates the points $\{(x_i, c_i)\}_{i=1}^d$ and maximizes its value $c_x$ at the input location $x$. The two cases $\mathds{P}1$ and $\mathds{P}1'$ are distinguished due to the matrix in \eqref{eq.P1constrA} becoming singular for any $x\in X$, and since it allows for one decision variable to be eliminated. Finally, the connection between \eqref{eq.infdimprob} and \eqref{eq.P2} is stated next.


\begin{theorem}
	 \label{thm.main}
	 {\normalfont \textbf{(Finite-dimensional equivalence):}}
	The objective in $\mathds{P}0$ attains its supremum in $\mathcal{H}$ and ${\normalfont \text{F}}(x) = {\normalfont \text{C}}(x)$ for any $x \in \Omega$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{my_proof}
	\label{app.thmproof}
	%
	Let $\mathds{X} := X \cup \{x\}$ and define the finite-dimensional subspace $\mathcal{H}^\Vert=\{f\in\mathcal{H}: f \in \text{span}(k(x_i,\cdot), x_i \in \mathds{X})\}$. Furthermore, let $\mathcal{H}^\perp = \{g\in \mathcal{H}: \rkinner{g}{f^\Vert}=0, \forall f^\Vert \in \mathcal{H}^{\Vert} \}$ be the orthogonal complement of $\mathcal{H}^{\Vert}$. Then, we have $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}^{\Vert} \oplus \mathcal{H}^\perp$ and for all $f\in \mathcal{H}$, $\exists f^{\Vert} \in \mathcal{H}^{\Vert}, f^\perp \in \mathcal{H}^\perp : f = f^{\Vert} + f^\perp$. By employing the latter decomposition and using the reproducing property, we can reformulate $\mathds{P}0$ in terms of $\mathcal{H}^{\Vert}$ and $\mathcal{H}^\perp$ as
	\begin{align}
%		& \sup_{\substack{f^{\Vert} \, \in \mathcal{H}^{\Vert} \\ f^\perp \, \in \mathcal{H}^\perp}} \hspace{-50pt} &&\left\{ 
%		\begin{aligned}
%			&\rkinner{f^{\Vert}+f^\perp}{k(x,\cdot)} :\\ &\rknorm{f^{\Vert}+f^\perp}^2 \leq \Gamma^2, \infnorm{(f^{\Vert}+f^\perp)_X - \mathsf{y}} \leq \bar \delta 
%		\end{aligned}
%		\right\} 
		& \sup_{\substack{f^{\Vert} \, \in \mathcal{H}^{\Vert} \\ f^\perp \, \in \mathcal{H}^\perp}} &&\left\{ 
		\begin{aligned}
			&\rkinner{f^{\Vert}+f^\perp}{k(x,\cdot)} : \hspace{-8pt}&\rknorm{f^{\Vert}+f^\perp}^2 \leq \Gamma^2, \infnorm{(f^{\Vert}+f^\perp)_X - \mathsf{y}} \leq \bar \delta 
		\end{aligned}
		\right\} 
		\\
		\overset{(i)}{=}& \sup_{\substack{f^{\Vert} \, \in \mathcal{H}^{\Vert} \\ f^\perp \, \in \mathcal{H}^\perp}} &&\left\{ f^{\Vert}(x) : \rknorm{f^{\Vert}}^2+\rknorm{f^\perp}^2 \leq \Gamma^2, \infnorm{f_{X}^\Vert - \mathsf{y}} \leq \bar \delta \right\} \\
		\overset{(ii)}{=}& \sup_{f^{\Vert} \, \in \mathcal{H}^{\Vert}} &&\left\{ f^{\Vert}(x) : \rknorm{f^{\Vert}}^2 \leq \Gamma^2, \infnorm{f^{\Vert}_{X} - \mathsf{y}} \leq \bar \delta \right\} \label{eq.last}
	\end{align}
	In $(i)$, the $f^\perp$ component vanished from the cost and from the last constraint due to orthogonality w.r.t. $k(x_i,\cdot) \in \mathcal{H}^\Vert$ for any $x_i \in \mathds{X}$; moreover, the Pythagorean relation $\rknorm{f}^2 = \rknorm{f^{\Vert}}^2 + \rknorm{f^\perp}^2$ was also used. To arrive at the second equality $(ii)$, one only has to note that the objective is insensitive to $f^\perp$ and that any $f^\perp \neq 0_{\mathcal{H}}$ would tighten the first constraint. 
	
	The attainment of the supremum is addressed next. Consider \eqref{eq.last} and denote the members of $\mathcal{H}^\Vert$ simply as $f$. $\rknorm{f}^2 \leq \Gamma^2$ is a closed and bounded constraint as it is the sublevel set of a norm. We transform $\infnorm{f_{X} - \mathsf{y}} \leq \bar \delta$ into $\vert f(x_i) - y_{i,j} \vert \leq \bar \delta$, $i=1,\dots,d, \, j =1,\dots,n_i$. Sets of the form $\{a \in \mathbb{R}: \vert a \vert \leq b \}$ are clearly closed in $\mathbb{R}$, hence \{$f(x_i) \in \mathbb{R} : \vert f(x_i) - y_{i,j}\vert \leq \bar \delta, \forall i,j \}$ is also closed. For any $x_i$, the evaluation functional $L_{x_i}(f) = f(x_i)$ is a linear operator and thus pre-images of closed sets are also closed. Consequently, $\{f \in \mathcal{H}^\Vert : \vert f(x_i) - y_{i,j}\vert \leq \bar \delta, \forall i,j \}$ is closed in $\mathcal{H}^\Vert$. The intersection of a finite number of closed sets is necessarily closed, thus all constraint present in \eqref{eq.last} define a closed feasible set. Since $\mathcal{H}^{\Vert}$ is finite-dimensional, any closed and bounded subset of it is compact (HeineโBorel); therefore, the continuous objective $L_x(f) = f(x)$ in \eqref{eq.last} attains a maximum by the Weierstrass extreme value theorem. 
	
	Finally, we establish the connection between $\mathds{P}0$ and $\mathds{P}1$. From the above arguments, an optimizer for $\mathds{P}0$ must lie in $\mathcal{H}^\Vert$. The members $f \in \mathcal{H}^\Vert$ have the form $f(z) = \alpha^\top K_{\mathds{X}z}$, being defined by the $\alpha$ weights. Due to the positive-definiteness of $k$, there exists a bijective map between outputs at the $\mathds{X}$ locations $f_{\mathds{X}} = \begin{bmatrix} f(x_1) & \dots & f(x_d) & f(x) \end{bmatrix}^\top$ and the weights $\alpha$, namely $\alpha = K_{\mathds{X}\mathds{X}}^{-1}f_{\mathds{X}}$. $K_{\mathds{X}\mathds{X}}$ denotes the kernel matrix associated with the set $\mathds{X} = X \cup \{x\}$. Consequently, optimizing over $f \in \mathcal{H}^\Vert$ is equivalent to optimizing over $\begin{bmatrix} f(x_1) & \dots & f(x_d) & f(x) \end{bmatrix}^\top =: \begin{bmatrix}c^\top & c_x\end{bmatrix}^\top$. The bounded norm condition can be recast as $\rknorm{f}^2 = \rkinner{f}{f} = \alpha^\top K_{\mathds{X}\mathds{X}} \alpha = \begin{bmatrix}c^\top & c_x\end{bmatrix} K_{\mathds{X}\mathds{X}}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix}c^\top & c_x\end{bmatrix}^\top$. The remaining constraint and the objective are straightforward. Noting that this reformulation is valid for any $x \in \Omega$ concludes the proof. 
\end{my_proof}

\begin{proposition} 
	\label{prop.complex_constraint_always_active}
	The inequality constraint \eqref{eq.P1constrA} is always active, i.e., let $(c^\star,c_x^\star)$ be an optimizer of $\mathds{P}1$, then $\begin{bmatrix}
		c ^\star\\
		c_x^\star
	\end{bmatrix}^\top 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		K_{XX} & K_{Xx} \\
		K_{xX} & k(x,x)
	\end{bmatrix}^{-1} 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		c^\star \\
		c_x^\star
	\end{bmatrix} = \Gamma^2 $. 
\end{proposition}

Given our knowledge on the noise influence $\bar \delta$, it is natural to ask what the limits of the uncertainty quantification technique considered herein are. For example, is the width of the envelope $\text{C}(x) - \text{B}(x)$ restricted to a certain minimum value that cannot be reduced even with the addition of new data? From \eqref{eq.P2constrB}, it is clear that at any input location $x_i \in X$, $\text{C}(x_i)$ and $\text{B}(x_i)$ cannot be more than $2\bar \delta$ apart. In addition to that, the presence of the complexity constraint \eqref{eq.P2constrA} can bring the two values closer to each other. Depending on how restrictive this latter constraint is for a given $x_i$, the corresponding output $y_i$ might lie outside the interval between $\text{C}(x_i)$ and $\text{B}(x_i)$. In this case, the resulting width is considerably reduced as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig.riskBound} (left).

\begin{figure}[b]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../images/chap2_width_A.pdf} \hspace{8pt}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../images/chap2_width_B.pdf}
	\caption{(Left) A sample lying outside of the uncertainty envelope, implying that the width is smaller than $\bar \delta$ at $x_j$. (Right) Redundant information is used to shrink the uncertainty envelope. In this scenario, we recover the ground-truth value at $x_i$ as $\text{C}(x_i) = \text{B}(x_i) = f^\star(x_i)$.}
	\label{fig.riskBound}
\end{figure}

\begin{proposition} 
	\label{prop.smallWidth}
	{\normalfont \textbf{(Width smaller than the noise bound):}}
	If $\exists \mathsf{y}_i$ such that $y_{i,j} > {\normalfont C}(x_i)$ or $y_{i,j} < \text{B}(x_i)$ for some $j$, then $\text{C}(x_i) - \text{B}(x_i) \leq \bar \delta$.
\end{proposition}

Suppose now one has sampled $(x_i,\mathsf{y}_i)$ with $\mathsf{y}_i = \begin{bmatrix} y_{i,1} & y_{i,2} \end{bmatrix}^\top$, $y_{i,1} = f^\star(x_i) + \bar \delta$ and $y_{i,2} = f^\star(x_i) - \bar \delta$. Then there is no uncertainty whatsoever about $f^\star$ at $x_i$ since $f^\star(x_i) = (y_{i,1} + y_{i,2})/2$ is the only possible value attainable by the ground-truth. This illustrates that the possibility of having multiple outputs at the same location allows for the uncertainty interval to shrink past the $\bar \delta$ width, and eventually even reduce to a singleton as shown in Figure~\ref{fig.riskBound} (right). Notwithstanding, the addition of a new datum to an existing dataset|be it in the form of a new output at an already sampled location or a completely new input-output pair|can only reduce the uncertainty.

\begin{proposition} 
	\label{prop.decreasing}
	{\normalfont \textbf{(Decreasing uncertainty)}}
	Let $C_{{\normalfont 1}}(x)$ denote the solution of $\mathds{P}1$ with a dataset $D_1 = \{(x_i,\mathsf{y}_i)\}_{i=1}^{d}$, and $C_{{\normalfont 2}}(x)$ the solution with $D_2 = D_1 \cup \{(x_{d+1},\mathsf{y}_{d+1})\}$. Then $C_{{\normalfont 2}}(x) \leq C_{{\normalfont 1}}(x)$ for any $x \in \Omega$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{my_proof}
	Given in Section~\ref{sec.selected_derivations}.
\end{my_proof}

%Let us take a closer look at the tightened constraint \eqref{eq.tightenedConstr}. The term $\bar c^\top K_{\bar X \bar X}^{-1} K_{\bar X z} =: s(z)$ represents an interpolating model passing through the output values $\bar c$, that is, $c$ and $c_x$ (see e.g. the discussion in Section~3.1 of \cite{maddalena2020deterministic}). If the difference $s(z) - c_z$ can be made small, then the tightening will also be reduced, whereas it will be significant if the difference is large. The result is of course dictated by the $\infty$-norm constraint, since $c_z$ cannot be more than $\bar \delta$ away from all the outputs $\mathsf{y}$ available at $z$. Therefore, a new datum will cause significant shrinkage of the envelope at a point $z \in \Omega$ when the new output causes $s(z) - c_z$ to be large, which intuitively can be seen as a measure of gained information through the new sample. Finally, this process is weighted by the inverse of the power function $P_{\bar X}^{-2}(z)$, which does not depend on any output, but only on the input locations. This indicates the advantage of evenly-spaced samples over random or bulked ones on the overall bound width. Example~1 in Section~\ref{sec::Result} confirms this intuition.

\begin{remark}
	Recovering the ground-truth as shown in Figure~\ref{fig.riskBound} (right) requires the noise realizations to match $\bar \delta$ and $-\bar \delta$; it is thus necessary to have tight noise bounds for it to happen. On the other hand, Proposition~\ref{prop.decreasing} guarantees the decreasing uncertainty property regardless of how accurate $\bar \delta$ is. Although not explicitly stated, a completely analogous result holds for the lower part of the envelope $\text{B}(x)$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{A sub-optimal solution}

The discussion in this subsection assumes that only one sample is present at each input location, i.e., $\mathsf{y}_i = y_i$ for $i=1,\dots,d $, so that $\mathsf{y}=y$.

In order to alleviate the computational complexity of having to solve two optimization problems at each query point, closed-form expressions can be employed instead. These surrogates yield sub-optimal bounds around any pre-specified kernel model of the form $s(x) = \alpha^\top K_{Xx}$, for some $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^d$. 
\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop:uniform}
	Let $s(x)=\alpha^\top K_{Xx}$, for a given $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Then, for any $x\in \Omega$, the ground-truth is bounded by $s(x) - S(x) \leq f^\star(x) \leq s(x) + S(x)$ with
	\begin{empheq}[box={\mymathbox[colback=black!2,drop small lifted shadow, sharp corners]}]{equation}
	%\begin{equation}
		S(x) =  P_X(x) \, \sqrt{ \Gamma^2 + \tilde\Delta } + \bar{\delta} \, \onenorm{K_{XX}^{-1}K_{Xx}} + \, \vert \tilde{s}(x) - s(x) \vert
		\label{eq.uniformBound2}
	%\end{equation}
	\end{empheq}
	where $\tilde{s}(x) = y^\top K_{XX}^{-1} K_{Xx}$, and the constant $\tilde\Delta$ is the minimum of the unconstrained convex problem $\min_{\nu \in \mathbb{R}^d} \left\{ \frac{1}{4}\nu^\top K_{XX}\nu + \nu^\top y + \bar{\delta} \onenorm{\nu}\right\}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	See Appendix~\ref{app.lemproof}.
\end{proof}

The map $\tilde{s}(x) = y^\top K_{XX}^{-1} K_{Xx}$ is an interpolant for the available outputs $y$. Note also that none of the terms in \eqref{eq.uniformBound2} depend on the model weights $\alpha$ with the exception of the last term $|\tilde s(x) - s(x)|$. Therefore, the width $S(x)$ will be minimized when $s(x) = \tilde s(x) \implies \alpha = y^\top K_{XX}^{-1}$. Since such a model would severely overfit, a balance between smoothing the data and not diverging too much from $\tilde s(x)$ has to be found. In our previous work \cite{maddalena2020deterministic}, we have illustrated how kernel ridge regression and minimum norm models are good candidate techniques to accomplish this goal.

By reformulating the optimal bounds, we uncover their relation with the suboptimal estimates given in Proposition~\ref{prop:uniform}. First, consider $\mathds{P}1$ and optimize over the decision variable $\delta = c - y$ rather than over $c$. Next, apply a quadratic decomposition identical to the one used in \eqref{eq.quadraticDecomp} to the complexity constraint \eqref{eq.P2constrA} and solve for $c_x$. After recalling that $\tilde{s}(x) = y^\top K_{XX}^{-1} K_{Xx}$ and $\rknorm{\tilde s}^2 = y^\top K_{XX}^{-1} y$, one obtains
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		c_x  \leq \;&  P(x) \sqrt{ \Gamma^2 - \rknorm{\tilde s}^2 - \delta^\top K_{XX}^{-1}\delta +2y^\top K_{XX}^{-1}\delta} +\tilde s(x) 
		+ \delta^\top K_{XX}^{-1}K_{Xx}
	\end{aligned}	
	\label{eq.ineq}
\end{equation}
Instead of maximizing $c_x$, the right-hand side of \eqref{eq.ineq} can be directly considered as the objective function equivalently. As a result, we obtain 
\[
\begin{aligned}
	\max_{\infnorm{\delta} \leq \bar \delta}\;\;& \tilde s(x) + P(x) \sqrt{ \Gamma^2 - \rknorm{\tilde s} - \delta^\top K_{XX}^{-1}\delta -2y^\top K_{XX}^{-1}\delta} + \delta^\top K_{XX}^{-1}K_{Xx} 
\end{aligned}
\]
Now, relax the problem by allowing $\delta$ to attain different values inside and outside the square-root
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}\notag
		\max_{\delta_1,\delta_2 \in \mathds{R}^{d}} &  \tilde s(x) + P(x) \sqrt{ \Gamma^2 - \rknorm{\tilde s}^2 - \delta_1^\top K_{XX}^{-1}\delta_1 +2y^\top K_{XX}^{-1}\delta_1} + \delta_2^\top K_{XX}^{-1}K_{Xx} \\ \label{eq.relaxedObjective}
		\text{\normalfont subj. to} & \;\; \; \infnorm{\delta_1} \leq \bar \delta, \; \infnorm{\delta_2} \leq \bar \delta 
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Note that the objective is separable and that $\tilde\Delta$ is the dual solution of 
\begin{equation}
	\max_{\delta_1 \in \mathbb{R}^d} \left\{ -\delta_1^\top K_{XX}^{-1}\delta_1 + 2y^\top K_{XX}^{-1}\delta_1 - \rknorm{\tilde s}^2 \right\}
\end{equation}
Also, $\max_{\delta_2 \in \mathbb{R}^d} \{ \delta_2^\top K_{XX}^{-1}K_{Xx} : \infnorm{\delta_2} \leq \bar\delta \} = \bar{\delta} \onenorm{K_{XX}^{-1}K_{Xx}}$ since these norms are duals of each other. Remember that the objective \eqref{eq.relaxedObjective} is a conservative upper bound for $f^\star(x)$, having $\tilde s(x)$ as the reference model. Given any smoother $s(x)$, the triangle inequality $|f(x) - s(x)| \leq |f(x) - \tilde s(x)| + |\tilde s(x) - s(x)|$ can be used to bound the distance between its predictions and the ground-truth values, arriving thus at the same expressions presented in Proposition~\ref{prop:uniform}.

From \eqref{eq.ineq}, the noise variable $\delta$ is seen to increase the maximum in two distinct ways: through the inner product $\delta^\top K_{XX}^{-1}K_{Xx}$, and via a norm augmentation corresponding to $\tilde\Delta$. One source of conservativeness in Proposition~\ref{prop:uniform} is taking into account the worst-possible inner-product and norm increase jointly. Despite this fact, they yield competitive results for moderate noise-levels as shown numerically in Section~\ref{sec::Result}. We moreover note that in the noise-free scenario, \eqref{eq.ineq} and \eqref{eq.relaxedObjective} are the same, and Proposition~\ref{prop:uniform} simplifies to the classical bounds in the interpolation case (see for instance \cite{fasshauer2011positive}).

\begin{remark}
	The sub-optimal bounds presented in this subsection feature a nominal model at their center, which is desirable in many practical situations. In the optimal scenario, the minimum norm regressor $s^\star(x) = \alpha^{\star\top} K_{Xx}$, $\alpha^\star = \text{arg}\min_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^d} \{ \alpha^\top K_{XX} \alpha : \infnorm{K_{XX} \alpha - y} \leq \bar\delta \}$ can be used as a nominal model. This choice is guaranteed to lie completely within $\text{C}(x)$ and $\text{B}(x)$|although not necessarily in the middle|since the map $s^\star$ belongs to $\mathcal{H}$ and is a feasible solution for $\mathds{P}0$.
\end{remark}

\section{Conclusions and outlook}

\section{Appendices}

\subsection{Estimating kernel hyperparameters}

Kernel functions typically feature a number of internal constants that need to be specified by the user, the so-called \textit{hyperparameters}. Although some theoretical properties remain insensitive to the final choice of hyperparameters\footnote{For instance, the squared-exponential kernel is universal (Definition~\ref{def.universal_kernel}) regardless of the its lengthscale value. On the other hand, it is known that if $k_\ell$ is a squared-exponential kernel with lengthscale $\ell$, then $\rkhs_{k_{\ell1}}$... \mycomment{cite Ingo's book}}, the numerical stability and real-world performance of kernel algorithms highly depend on the tuning of these numbers \citep{fasshauer2011positive}. 

One popular approach to optimizing kernel hyperparameters is to consider the log marginal likelihood objective of a Gaussian process with Gaussian measurement noise, and apply a gradient-based numerical algorithm to it \citep[ยง5.4.1]{williams2006gaussian}. This amounts to solving a smooth, unconstrained non-convex optimization problem to local optimality.  Two appealing ... of this approach are the continuous nature of the search and the inherent regularization properties of the objective, known to combat overfitting. 

Bayesian optimization (BayesOpt) is another widely adopted methodology to fine-tune hyperparameters against a pre-specified objective function \citep{snoek2012practical,shahriari2015taking}. BayesOpt operates on pairs of hyperparameters and their associated objective function values, and constructs a model for their unknown relationship. Next, a so-called \textit{acquisition function} based on the model is then employed to tell bad hyperparameters from promising ones \citep{wilson2018maximizing}. A new set of parameters is finally chosen to be experimented with and its performance is measured. This new piece of information is incorporated into the dataset and the process is repeated until some termination criterion is reached. Interestingly, the most popular model class used when reconstructing the aforementioned unknown relationship is Gaussian process, which is itself based on kernels whose own hyperparameters have to be set by the users.

Lastly, we could also mention the different flavors of cross-validation (CV). The procedure builds an estimate of how suitable a set of hyperparameters are by evaluating the resulting model performance on unseen data. More specifically, it consists in shuffling and splitting the available data into batches, say $N$; making use of $N-1$ batches to define the model and the last one to assess its performance; the process is repeated $N$ times rotating the batches and yielding $N$ performance measures, which could be combined through averaging for instance. By following this algorithm, the most suitable hyperparameter value could be found from a predefined list of possible values. Note that, the log marginal likelihood itself could be a valid performance objective within CV \citep[ยง5.4.2]{williams2006gaussian}.

\subsection{Estimating RKHS norms}

Members $f \in \rkhs$ are either finite weighted sums of partially evaluated kernels $k(x,\cdot)$ or limits of sequences of such sums (see Section~\ref{sec.formalism_of_kernels}). Assume $f$ enjoys a finite expansion of $N$ terms, then
\begin{align}
	\Vert f \Vert_\rkhs^2 &= \langle f, f \rangle_\rkhs \label{eq.rkhs_norm_eq1} \\
	&= \left\langle \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i k(x_i,\cdot), \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i k(x_i,\cdot) \right\rangle_\rkhs \label{eq.rkhs_norm_eq2} \\
	&= \alpha^\top K_{XX} \alpha \label{eq.rkhs_norm_eq3}
\end{align}
where \eqref{eq.rkhs_norm_eq1} is the RKHS norm definition, \eqref{eq.rkhs_norm_eq2} is the inner-product definition, and \eqref{eq.rkhs_norm_eq3} follows from the inner-product linearity and from the reproducing property of kernels (see \eqref{eq.reproducing_property}). As a result, the norm $\Vert f \Vert_\rkhs$ can be exactly and easily computed as long as we have at hand the weights $\alpha$ that define $f$.

In practice, it is hard to imagine a situation where the coefficients $\alpha$ would be known for a given physical system. Suppose however that we have a dataset at hand $\{(x_i,f_{x_i})\}\}_{i=1}^n$, where $f_{x_i} = f(x_i)$. The inputs $x_i$ need to be pairwise-distinct. Assume that $k$ is SDP and consider the function $s_n(x) := \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i k(x_i,x)$, $\alpha = K_{XX}^{-1} f_X$, which reproduces our dataset at every input, i.e., $s_n(x_i) = f_{x_i}$. According to the well-known optimal recovery property \cite[ยง8.3]{iske2018approximation}, $s_n$ not only interpolates the dataset, but also attains a minimum RKHS norm while doing so and, moreover, $\Vert s_n \Vert_\rkhs \leq \Vert f \Vert_\rkhs$ for any number of samples $n$. In view of the quadratic form \eqref{eq.rkhs_norm_eq3}, it is evident that for any new pair $(x_{n+1},f_{x_{n+1}})$ added to the dataset, $\Vert s_{n+1} \Vert_\rkhs \geq \Vert s_n \Vert_\rkhs$ holds. One can finally show that if samples are acquired distributed enough to fill the domain\footnote{minimize the fill distance}, then $\Vert f \Vert_\rkhs$ is the least upper bound of the $\Vert s_n \Vert_\rkhs$ sequence and, from the monotone convergence theorem, $\Vert s_n \Vert_\rkhs \rightarrow \Vert f \Vert_\rkhs$ is guaranteed.

The discussion above showed that the RKHS norm $\Vert f \Vert_\rkhs$ can indeed be estimated from below from samples $\{(x_i,f_{x_i})\}_{i=1}^n$. This is done by simply evaluating the norm of the interpolant for which we know the weights $\alpha$
\begin{equation}
\Vert s_n \Vert_\rkhs^2 = \alpha^\top K_{XX} \alpha = f_{X}^\top K_{XX}^{-1} f_{X}
\end{equation}
The more samples we have, the closer the quadratic form will be from the target value $\Vert f \Vert_\rkhs$. Consider the example below for observations on how the estimation process unfolds in a practical scenario.

Let $k$ be the squared-exponential with lengthscale $\ell = 0.5$ $f$...

Up to this point, only noiseless samples were consider. Suppose now the data come in the form $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ with $x_i$ pairwise distinct and $y_i=f(x_i) + \delta_i$. Let the additive noise be bounded by some known value $\bar \delta \geq |\delta_i|$ for all $i$. Since we do not have access to the evaluations of $f$ anymore, $\Vert s_n \Vert_\rkhs$ cannot be computed. If we naively interpolate the data with the model $\tilde s_n(x) := \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i k(x_i,x)$, $\alpha = K_{XX}^{-1} y$, the resulting norm $\Vert \tilde s_n \Vert_\rkhs^2 = y^\top K_{XX}^{-1}y$ can be either larger or smaller than its noise-free counterpart. The mismatch between the two will depend on how each $\delta_i$ will disturb the samples, and its maximum effects can be exactly computed.

\begin{proposition}
	Let $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ be such that $x_i$ are pairwise distinct and $y_i = f(x_i) + \delta_i$ with $\bar \delta \geq |\delta_i|$ for all $i$. Let $s_n$ and $\tilde s_n$ be respectively the models interpolating the noise-free $f_X$ and the noisy $y$ values of $f$, i.e., $s_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i k(x_i,x)$, $\alpha = K_{XX}^{-1} f_X$ and $\tilde s_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i k(x_i,x)$, $\alpha = K_{XX}^{-1} y$. It then holds that
	\begin{equation}
		\nabla \leq \Vert s_n \Vert_\rkhs^2 - \Vert \tilde s_n \Vert_\rkhs^2 \leq \Delta
	\end{equation}
	where $\Delta$ and $\nabla$ denote respectively the maximum and minimum of $-\delta^\top K_{XX}^{-1} \delta + 2y^\top K_{XX}^{-1} \delta$ over $\delta$, subject to $|\delta| \leq \bar \delta$.
	\label{prop.norms_mismatch}
\end{proposition}

Calculating $\Delta$ amounts to solving a convex optimization problem since it is the maximum of a strictly concave function, whereas $\nabla$ is not as simple.

\begin{my_proof}
	\textbf{Proof of Proposition~\ref{prop.complex_constraint_always_active}:}
	It follows from the objective being linear and only sensitive to $c_x$ and from reformulating \eqref{eq.P1constrA}. More concretely, we use the matrix inversion lemma and the definition of $P_X(x)$ to re-write the complexity constraint as
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
			\begin{bmatrix}
				c \\
				c_x
			\end{bmatrix}^\top 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				K_{XX} & K_{Xx} \\
				K_{xX } & k(x,x)
			\end{bmatrix}^{-1} 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				c \\
				c_x
			\end{bmatrix} & \leq \Gamma^2 
		   \label{eq.appendix_complex_constr_terms1}
		   \\
			%
			\Leftrightarrow \;
			c^\top K^{-1}_{XX} c
			+
			P_{X}^{-2}(x) \, \left( c^\top K_{XX}^{-1} K_{Xx} - c_x \right)^2 
			&\leq \Gamma^2 
			\label{eq.appendix_complex_constr_terms}
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}
	Note that $P_X^{-2}(x) > 0$ since $P_X(x) > 0$ for any $x$ not in $X$ \citep{karvonen2022error}. As a result, we see that \eqref{eq.appendix_complex_constr_terms} depends quadratically on $c_x$. Therefore, for any feasible $(c, c_x)$ such that \eqref{eq.appendix_complex_constr_terms1} inactive, there exists $ \tilde c_x := c_x + \varepsilon, \varepsilon > 0$ such that $(c,\tilde c_x)$ attains a higher objective while satisfying the constraints.
\end{my_proof}

\begin{my_proof}
	\textbf{Proof of Proposition~\ref{prop.decreasing}:}
	Denote by $\mathds{P}1_1$ the problem solved with $D_1$ and decision variables $\begin{bmatrix} c & c_x \end{bmatrix}$. Similarly, $\mathds{P}1_2$ is associated with the dataset $D_2$ and the decision variables $\begin{bmatrix} c & c_x & c_z \end{bmatrix}$, where $c_z$ are due to the additional input in $D_2$. Since $D_2$ contains all members of $D_1$, the $\infty$-norm constraint of $\mathds{P}1_2$ can be recast as that of $\mathds{P}1_1$ and an additional constraint for $c_z$ and the new outputs. Let $\mathds{X}  := X \cup \{x\}$, $\bar c := \begin{bmatrix} c^\top c_x \end{bmatrix}^\top$ and $z := x_{d+1}$ be shorthand variables to ease notation. The complexity constraint of $\mathds{P}1_2$ is then
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
			\begin{bmatrix}
				\bar c \\
				c_z
			\end{bmatrix}^\top 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				K_{\mathds{X} \mathds{X} } & K_{\mathds{X}  z} \\
				K_{z \mathds{X} } & k(z,z)
			\end{bmatrix}^{-1} 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				\bar c \\
				c_z
			\end{bmatrix} & \leq \Gamma^2 \\
			%
			\overset{(i)}{\Leftrightarrow}
			\bar c^\top K_{\mathds{X} \mathds{X} }^{-1} \bar c +
			P_{\mathds{X} }^{-2}(z) \, 
			%\begin{bmatrix}
			%	\bar c \\
			%	c_z
			%\end{bmatrix}^\top
			%\begin{bmatrix}
			%	K_{\bar X \bar X}^{-1} K_{\bar X z} \\
			%	-1
			%\end{bmatrix}
			\left\|
			\begin{bmatrix}
				K_{\mathds{X} \mathds{X} }^{-1} K_{\mathds{X} z} \\
				-1
			\end{bmatrix}
			\begin{bmatrix}
				\bar c \\
				c_z
			\end{bmatrix}\right\|_2^2
			& \leq \Gamma^2 \\
			%
			\overset{(ii)}{\Leftrightarrow} \;
			\begin{bmatrix}
				c \\
				c_x
			\end{bmatrix}^\top 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				K_{XX} & K_{Xx} \\
				K_{xX} & k(x,x)
			\end{bmatrix}^{-1} 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				c \\
				c_x
			\end{bmatrix} \label{eq.tightenedConstr}%\\\notag
			+
			P_{\mathds{X} }^{-2}(z) \, \left( \bar c^\top K_{\mathds{X} \mathds{X} }^{-1} K_{\mathds{X} z} - c_z \right)^2 
			&\leq \Gamma^2 
		\end{align}
		\label{eq.quadraticDecomp}
	\end{subequations}
	where the matrix identity found in Appendix~\ref{app.blockMatrixIdent} was used in $(i)$ and $P^2_{\mathds{X} }(z) = k(z,z) - K_{z \mathds{X} } K_{\mathds{X} \mathds{X} }^{-1} K_{\mathds{X} z}$. In $(ii)$, the definitions of $\bar c$ and $\mathds{X} $ were used. Thanks to $P_{\mathds{X} }(z) \geq 0, \forall z$ and the quadratic term multiplying it, we conclude that for any choice of the decision variable $c_z$, \eqref{eq.tightenedConstr} is a tightened version of the complexity constraint of $\mathds{P}1_1$, which is \eqref{eq.P2constrA}. As a result, the maximum of $\mathds{P}1_2$ is lower or equal than that of $\mathds{P}1_1$.

\begin{my_proof}
	\textbf{Proof of Proposition~\ref{prop.smallWidth}:}
	Follows from $\text{C}(x_i) \geq \text{B}(x_i)$, $\text{C}(x_i) \leq y_{i,j} + \bar \delta$ and $\text{B}(x_i) \geq y_{i,j} - \bar \delta$ for any $i=1,\dots,d$ and any $j=1,\dots,n_i$.

\begin{my_proof}
	\textbf{Proof of Proposition~\ref{prop.norms_mismatch}:}
